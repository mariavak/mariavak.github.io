I am an assistant professor (MCF) in applied mathematics at [CentraleSupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/), University Paris Saclay in France and the group leader of the [biomathematics](http://biomathematics.mics.centralesupelec.fr/) group of MICS Laboratory focusing on mathematical modeling in Life Sciences. Moreover, I am affliated with [Inria Saclay](https://opis-inria.eu/) in France and [Archimedes Unit](https://archimedesai.gr/en) in Greece. My main research interest include the development of computational methods for image perception focusing on earth observation and medical applications.

Before that, I was a postdoctoral student at CentraleSupelec, where I worked with [Nikos Paragios](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikos-paragios-20777869/?originalSubdomain=fr). I completed my PhD at the Remote Sensing Laboratory at the School of Rural, Surveying and Geo-Informatics Engineering of the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) under the supervision of [Konstantinos Karantzalos](http://users.ntua.gr/karank/). 

I am always interested on new collaborations and we are currently searching for motivated students and postdocs to join our team!

<a href="mailto:maria.vakalopoulou@centralesupelec.fr">Email me</a>, if you want to discuss about our research and our current openings.
