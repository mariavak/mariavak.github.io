Computational Pathology has revolutionized histopathological analysis by leveraging sophisticated computational techniques to augment clinical workflows. Our team is implicated in multiple projects such as [Hagnodice](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjWgMm9uPOCAxVEVKQEHRVEAaIQFnoECA0QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanr.fr%2FProject-ANR-21-CE45-0007&usg=AOvVaw31mm1Qvi4SfzbH09Ts0Rn_&opi=89978449), [FRQS and HDH](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7135491326636142592/), [Prism](https://prism.center/about-prism/) and [Archimedes Unit](https://www.athenarc.gr/en/archimedes) to develop novel methods for processing gigapixel sized digital pathology slides for variety of cancer types.

- In [Zhang et. al 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12105.pdf) we propose a precise location-based matching mechanism that utilizes the overlapping information between geometric transformations to precisely match regions in two augmentations. We demonstrated very good performance on unsupervised nuclei segmentation of digital pathology.
